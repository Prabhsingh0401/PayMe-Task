Overview
Developed a website using Vite + React for the front end and SCSS for styling. The website was designed based on a provided Figma file, which served as the design reference. The goal was to ensure pixel-perfect design fidelity and smooth user experience.

Technologies
Vite: Chosen for its fast build times and seamless integration with React.

React: Utilized for component-based architecture, enabling reusable UI components for a modular and maintainable codebase.

SCSS: Used for styling due to its nesting capabilities, variables, and mixins, which provide better flexibility and organization for large-scale styling.

The project was developed with a focus on delivering a high-performance, responsive, and aesthetically consistent website, in line with the provided Figma design. The use of modern development tools such as Vite, React, and SCSS allowed for a smooth and efficient workflow.
